This short lesson summarizes key takeaways from section 44.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:

* A Sequence Model is a general term for a special class of Deep Neural Networks that work with a time series of data as an input
* In the deep learning context, sequence models are also referred to as "Recurrent Neural Networks" (RNNs)
* Sequence Models are often used for text classification, sequence generation, etc.
* A basic Recurrent Neural Network is a neural network that passes it's output from a given example back into itself as input for the next example (which feels a little bit like the time series models we've seen)
* RNN architectures use a special type of backpropagation referred to as "backpropagation through time"
* To special types of RNNs are referred to as "Long Short Term Memory" (LSTM) and "Gated Recurrent Unit" (GRU) models.
